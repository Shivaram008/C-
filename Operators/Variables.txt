Non-static  or Instance
static		//can be modified
constants	//can not modified and initialized while declaration
readonly	//can not modified once initialized and we can declare first and initialized later in constructors etc.,


if a variable is explicitly declared by using the static modifier or else if it is declared in a 
static block is said to be a static variable.

In the life cycle of a class a static variable is initialized one and only one time, and instance
variable is initialized 0 times if no instances are created and N times if N instances are created.

Instance variables can be initialized through constructors also.


If a variable is declared by using const we call it as a constant variable. These can not be modified
after their declaration. 

static variable can be modified but constants can not be modified.

Readonly variable behaviour is similar to non-static variables.

Constant variable is a fixed value for the whole class where as readonly variable is a fixed value
specific to an instance of class.
