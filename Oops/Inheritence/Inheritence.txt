Inheritence :
-Its a mechanism of consuming the members of one class in another class by establishing parent/child relationship between classes. 

Provides Reusability

Child class can consume members of its parent class except private members of parent.


1.Parent class constructor must be accesible to child class

2.In inheritence child class can access parent class members but not vice-versa.

3.We can initialize a parent class variables by using child class instance to make it as a reference.

4.Every class is inherited from Object class of System namespace

5.C# doesnt support multiple inheritence through classes

6.Child class can implicitly call parent class constructor only when it is parameter less unless we need to call the base class explicitly.
